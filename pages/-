Working with the GNU/Linux stack since 2003
and freelancing since 2015. Many of my 
projects have been for embedded systems and have used the C or C++ languages.
Below is a list of recent clients and employers, and of projects I completed for them. 

I am always interested in discussing new
projects; feel free to [contact me](/contact/) to discuss yours. I have a
particular interest in work that will be contributed to open source
projects and will offer highly competitive rates thereon.

Gnarbox, the world’s first mobile solution for viewing, backing-up, editing, and sharing HD footage, needed a platform device driver to control a USB port mux based on the status of GPIO/interrupt lines. I authored this driver in addition to helping with various other low-level issues.

I have successfully contracted with Zodiac Inflight Innovations, a leading provider of 
[in-flight entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-flight_entertainment) solutions, 
on numerous projects.

#### (Current) Multicast data distribution and video streaming 
Encrypted distribution of media content to seatback units.
#### Interfacing with a seat actuation controller 
> "Our work with Rick involved low level communications between an RS-485 seat actuation system and our IFE System. Under an extremely tight schedule for one of our most important customers, Rick provided a software solution that met our customer’s needs with a high degree of quality. The requirements for this software were fluid and Rick was agile enough to update the design and implementation to meet the new requirements in a timely manner while communicating effect with stakeholders."\

#### Linux driver for a bug affecting ~20,000 shipped units 
I created a block device driver which intercepted `struct bio` instances destined for a problematic storage device, performing necessary hardware resets while holding those instances in queue.
> "... Reduced passenger initiated resets by 10%. ..."\

At SpaceX I helped with initial bringup of a PowerPC P2020 platform and maintenance of a PowerPC 8641D platform, including creation of device tree files and platform code changes. I made extensive changes to U-boot including introduction of new commands and adding new functionality to ethernet phy drivers.
