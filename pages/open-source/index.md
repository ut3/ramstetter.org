title: Open Source Contributions
---


...are too few in number! I am actively looking to solve this problem. 
I will offer highly competive rates on work for projects that will be
open sourced via upstream contribution: [contact me](/contact).

Below is a list of open source projects to which I have contributed, and a brief summary of my contribution.


## Coin Price Indicatior

I [added support for the Gemini.com Bitcoin exchange](https://github.com/nilgradisnik/coinprice-indicator/pull/17) to this current-Bitcoin-price tray icon.

## Monero cryptocurrency CPU miner (xmr-stak-cpu)

I [added a fix for building on Windows](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak-amd/pull/94).
